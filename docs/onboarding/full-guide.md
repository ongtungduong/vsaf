## 1. What is VSAF?

VSAF (Version-controlled Spec-driven Agentic Framework) is a development
framework built around Claude Code. It turns "ask the AI, copy-paste the output,
hope it works" into a structured, repeatable process:

1. **Write a spec first** — before any code is generated.
2. **Let AI agents plan** — analysts, PMs, and architects each do their job.
3. **Execute with guardrails** — TDD (Test-Driven Development) cycles with
   automatic security checks.
4. **Review in 3 layers** — methodology compliance, spec compliance, and
   knowledge-graph sync.
5. **Track decisions** — so you know *why* something was built a certain way six
   months from now.

### The 4-Layer Architecture

VSAF organizes its 8 tools into four layers. Each layer handles a different
concern:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PLANNING          BMAD (agents) ──▶ OpenSpec (specs, tasks, verify) │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CODE INTEL        GitNexus (MCP backbone) + Graphify (multimodal)   │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  MEMORY            claude-mem (auto) + MemPalace (knowledge base)   │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  IMPLEMENTATION    Claude Code + Superpowers + ECC cherry-pick       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Planning** — BMAD provides agile-style AI agents (Analyst, PM, Architect,
  Product Owner) that help you clarify requirements and write specs. OpenSpec
  turns those specs into structured proposals, designs, and atomic task lists.
- **Code Intelligence** — GitNexus builds a knowledge graph of your codebase via
  MCP (Model Context Protocol), so you can ask "what breaks if I change X?"
  Graphify adds a multimodal (visual + textual) knowledge graph with dependency
  path tracing.
- **Memory** — claude-mem automatically captures what you did in each session
  (files changed, commands run) and re-injects that context on your next
  session. MemPalace stores deliberate, permanent knowledge: architecture
  decisions, design rationale, team agreements.
- **Implementation** — Claude Code is your AI coding agent. Superpowers adds a
  methodology layer (brainstorm → plan → TDD → review). ECC (Everything Claude
  Code) cherry-pick provides security scanning and coding-standard hooks without
  the overhead of the full plugin.

### The 10-Step Workflow (Bird's-Eye View)

Every feature or bug fix follows this cycle. Bug fixes ("Quick Flow") skip steps
3–5.

| Step | What Happens | Key Command |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 0 | One-time setup | `make setup` |
| 1 | Understand the codebase | Read `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` |
| 2 | Scope the work | `*agent analyst` |
| 3 | Plan (PRD + architecture) | `*agent pm`, `*agent architect` |
| 4 | Write specs | `/opsx:propose <feature>` |
| 5 | Impact analysis | GitNexus MCP + Graphify queries |
| 6 | Brainstorm + plan tasks | `/superpowers:brainstorm` |
| 7 | Execute (TDD) | `/superpowers:execute-plan` |
| 8 | 3-layer self-review | `/superpowers:code-review` + `make verify` + `make index` |
| 9 | Push PR | `git push` with spec link + impact summary |
| 10 | Archive + ship | `make archive`, tag, deploy |

Each step is explained in detail in [Section 5](#5-your-first-project--a-walkthrough).

## 2. How the Tools Fit Together

### Tool Overview

| Tool | What It Does | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| **Claude Code** | The AI coding agent that runs in your terminal. Everything else plugs into it. | $20/mo |
| **BMAD Method** | Provides AI "team members" (Analyst, PM, Architect, PO) for planning. | Free |
| **OpenSpec** | Converts plans into structured specs, designs, and task lists. Verifies that your code matches the spec. | Free |
| **Superpowers** | Adds brainstorming, planning, TDD execution, and code review commands to Claude Code. | Free |
| **ECC cherry-pick** | Security scanner (AgentShield, 102 rules) + git hooks that block secrets and protect config files + coding standards for Go, Rust, and Python. | Free |
| **GitNexus** | Builds a code knowledge graph. Answers "what depends on X?" and "what breaks if I change Y?" via MCP. | Free |
| **Graphify** | Builds a multimodal knowledge graph with visual dependency maps. Can trace paths between services. | Free |
| **claude-mem** | Auto-pilot memory: captures every session automatically, re-injects context next time. Zero configuration. | Free |
| **MemPalace** | Knowledge base for deliberate storage: architecture decisions, design rationale, team agreements. Verbatim, lossless, with a temporal knowledge graph. | Free |

### Superpowers vs. ECC — What's the Difference?

These two tools seem similar at first glance, but they serve very different
purposes:

**Superpowers** is your *methodology engine*. It provides the workflow commands
you explicitly call during development:

- `/superpowers:brainstorm` — Socratic Q&A to explore alternatives before coding
- `/superpowers:write-plan` — Generates a step-by-step task list with
  verification steps
- `/superpowers:execute-plan` — Runs the plan using a RED → GREEN → REFACTOR TDD
  cycle
- `/superpowers:code-review` — Reviews your code against the plan, standards,
  and architecture

**ECC cherry-pick** is your *security guardrails*. It runs passively in the
background:

- **AgentShield** — On-demand security scanner with 102 rules
  (`npx ecc-agentshield scan`)
- **Git hooks** — Automatically block commits that contain secrets or modify
  protected config files
- **Language skills** — Coding standards for Go, Rust, and Python that Claude
  applies automatically

> **Why "cherry-pick"?** The full ECC plugin consumes too much of Claude's
> context window (reduces usable context from ~200K to ~70K tokens). VSAF
> installs only three components: AgentShield, hooks, and language skills.

### The Dual Memory Model

VSAF uses two memory systems because they solve different problems:

| | claude-mem | MemPalace |
|---|---|---|
| **How it works** | Runs automatically in the background. Zero configuration. | You explicitly add knowledge and search for it. |
| **What it stores** | Session history: files changed, commands run, debug context | Architecture decisions, design rationale, team knowledge |
| **Storage format** | AI-compressed summaries (may lose some reasoning detail) | Verbatim, lossless (preserves exact reasoning) |
| **Example question** | "What file did I edit yesterday?" | "Why did we choose Patroni over Stolon?" |
| **Temporal awareness** | No — flat history | Yes — can detect outdated facts and invalidate them |
| **Startup cost** | Auto-injects context at session start | 170 tokens at startup, then on-demand search |

**Rule of thumb:**
- If it happened in a coding session → claude-mem already captured it.
- If it's a decision worth remembering in 6 months → store it in MemPalace.

### GitNexus vs. Graphify — What's the Difference?

Both analyze your codebase, but in different ways:

- **GitNexus** is the **MCP backbone**. It parses your code's AST (Abstract
  Syntax Tree — the structural representation of your code), builds a knowledge
  graph, and exposes it to Claude Code via MCP. When you ask "what breaks if I
  change `PaymentService`?", GitNexus answers from its graph. It also provides a
  web UI (`gitnexus serve`) for browsing.

- **Graphify** is a **multimodal knowledge graph**. It generates a visual HTML
  graph (`graphify-out/graph.html`) and a human-readable report
  (`graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`). It can trace dependency paths between
  services (`/graphify path ServiceA ServiceB`) and identify "god nodes" — files
  or classes with too many connections.

**Use both.** GitNexus answers precise impact questions. Graphify gives you the
big picture and finds structural problems. Always re-index both after a merge
(`make index`).

## 3. Prerequisites

Before installing VSAF, make sure you have the following on your system. For
each item, there is a command you can run to verify.

| Requirement | Minimum Version | Check Command |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 18+ | `node -v` |
| npm | (comes with Node) | `npm -v` |
| Python | 3.10+ | `python3 --version` |
| pip3 | (comes with Python) | `pip3 --version` |
| pipx | any | `pipx --version` |
| git | any | `git --version` |
| jq | any | `jq --version` |
| Claude Code | active subscription | — |

**Operating system:** Ubuntu 24.x or macOS.

**Claude Code:** You need an active Claude Code subscription ($20/month). This
is the only paid component. All other tools are free.

**Why pipx?** Modern Linux distributions (PEP 668) prevent installing Python
packages globally with pip. pipx creates isolated environments for each tool
automatically. Install it with:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install pipx
pipx ensurepath

# macOS
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

---

## 4. Installation

### Quick Path

If all prerequisites are installed, three commands set up everything:

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd vsaf
make setup          # Installs all 8 tools (idempotent — safe to re-run)
make status         # Verify everything is working
```

Then one manual step inside an interactive Claude Code session:

```
/plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official
```

Restart Claude Code after installing Superpowers.

That's it. The rest of this section explains what `make setup` does under the
hood, in case you need to debug or install tools individually.

### What `make setup` Does (Step by Step)

The setup script (`scripts/setup-vsaf.sh`) is idempotent: running it multiple
times is safe. It skips tools that are already installed.

#### 4.1 BMAD Method

```bash
npx bmad-method install
```

Installs agile AI agent definitions into your project. After this, you will see
a `.bmad` directory or `.bmad-method.json` in your project root. These define
the Analyst, PM, Architect, and PO agents you can invoke with `*agent <role>`.

#### 4.2 OpenSpec

```bash
npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest
openspec init
```

Installs the OpenSpec CLI globally and initializes an `openspec/` workspace in
your project. This workspace holds proposals, specs, designs, and task lists.
You interact with it through slash commands like `/opsx:propose`.

#### 4.3 ECC Cherry-Pick

```bash
# Temporary clone (removed after install)
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code.git /tmp/ecc
```

The setup script extracts three things from the ECC repository:

1. **Hooks** — Merged into `~/.claude/settings.json`. These are `PreToolUse`
   and `PostToolUse` hooks that automatically block commits containing secrets
   and protect critical config files.

2. **Language skills** — Copied to `~/.claude/skills/`. These are coding
   standards for Go, Rust, and Python that Claude Code applies when generating
   code in those languages.

3. **AgentShield** — No installation needed. You run it on-demand with
   `npx ecc-agentshield scan`.

The temporary clone is deleted after extraction.

> **Why not install the full ECC plugin?** The full plugin adds extensive context
> that reduces Claude's usable context window from ~200K to ~70K tokens. By
> cherry-picking only these three components, you get the security benefits
> without the context overhead.

#### 4.4 GitNexus

```bash
npm install -g gitnexus
gitnexus setup
gitnexus analyze .
gitnexus analyze --skills
```

Installs GitNexus globally, runs its initial setup, and indexes your current
repository. After indexing, Claude Code can answer questions about code
dependencies through the GitNexus MCP server. You can also browse the knowledge
graph with `gitnexus serve` (opens a web UI).

#### 4.5 Graphify

```bash
pipx install graphifyy
graphify install
```

Installs Graphify via pipx (isolated Python environment). The `graphify install`
command registers a `PreToolUse` hook with Claude Code. After installation, run
`/graphify .` inside a Claude Code session to build the initial graph. Output
appears in the `graphify-out/` directory:

- `graph.html` — Interactive visual dependency map (open in a browser)
- `GRAPH_REPORT.md` — Human-readable report of your codebase structure

#### 4.6 claude-mem (Auto-Pilot Memory)

```bash
npx claude-mem install
```

Registers 5 hooks with Claude Code that automatically:

- Capture session activity (files edited, commands run, tool usage)
- Compress and store session summaries
- Re-inject relevant context at the start of your next session

No configuration needed. After installation, a web viewer is available at
`http://localhost:37777` where you can browse captured session history.

#### 4.7 MemPalace (Knowledge Base)

```bash
pipx install mempalace
mempalace init <project-directory>
claude mcp add mempalace -- python -m mempalace.mcp_server
```

Installs MemPalace via pipx, initializes a "palace" for your project, and
registers it as an MCP server with Claude Code. This gives Claude Code access to
19 MCP tools for searching, adding, and managing your knowledge base.

Key commands you will use:

- `mempalace search "query"` — Find past decisions or knowledge
- `mempalace status` — Check palace occupancy and health
- `mempalace mine ~/chats/ --mode convos` — Extract decisions from conversation
  logs (run weekly)

#### 4.8 Superpowers (Manual Step)

Superpowers is a Claude Code plugin that cannot be installed from a shell script.
You must run this command inside an **interactive Claude Code session**:

```
/plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official
```

Then **restart Claude Code**.

After installation, you will have access to these commands:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/superpowers:brainstorm` | Socratic Q&A — explore alternatives before committing to an approach |
| `/superpowers:write-plan` | Generate a step-by-step task list with verification steps |
| `/superpowers:execute-plan` | Execute the plan using RED → GREEN → REFACTOR TDD cycles |
| `/superpowers:code-review` | Review code against the plan, coding standards, and architecture |

You can verify Superpowers is installed by running `/help` inside Claude Code —
the Superpowers commands should appear in the list.

### Post-Installation Verification

After setup completes, run:

```bash
make status
```

This checks each tool and reports its status:

| Check | What It Verifies |
|---|---|
| GitNexus | Repository is indexed and queryable |
| MemPalace | Palace is initialized and accessible |
| OpenSpec | CLI is available, workspace initialized |
| Graphify | Output directory exists (graph has been built) |
| claude-mem | Web viewer is running at localhost:37777 |

If any check fails, review the setup output for warnings about that specific
tool.

### Git Hooks

The setup script configures git to use the `githooks/` directory for hooks:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath githooks/
```

Currently, a **pre-push hook** is installed that automatically runs `make verify`
(spec compliance check) and `make scan` (security scan) before allowing a push.
If either check fails, the push is blocked.

## 5. Your First Project — A Walkthrough

This section walks through the 10-step workflow using a concrete example: adding
a `/health` endpoint to a web service. Follow along to see how the tools work
together.

### Step 1: Understand the Codebase

Before writing any code, get familiar with what exists.

```bash
# Open the Graphify report to understand the codebase structure
cat graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md

# Start the GitNexus web UI to browse interactively
gitnexus serve

# Ask about structural issues
/graphify query "what are the god nodes?"

# Trace how two components are connected
/graphify path AuthService DatabasePool

# Check if the team made relevant past decisions
# (Claude Code will auto-search MemPalace when you ask)
"Has anyone worked on health checks before?"
```

> **Rule:** Do not modify code on day one. Spend this time understanding.

### Step 2: Scope the Work

Use the BMAD Analyst agent to clarify what needs to be done:

```
*agent analyst
```

The Analyst will ask clarifying questions about your feature: who needs it, what
the acceptance criteria are, and how complex it is.

Then initialize the workflow:

```
*workflow-init
```

This asks you to choose a flow:

- **Quick Flow** — for bug fixes and small changes. Skips Steps 3–5 (planning,
  specs, impact analysis) and goes straight to brainstorming (Step 6).
- **Standard Flow** — for typical features. Goes through all 10 steps.
- **Enterprise Flow** — for large, cross-team changes. Adds extra review gates.

For our `/health` endpoint, Standard Flow is appropriate.

If you are unsure what to do next at any point, run:

```
bmad-help
```

### Step 3: Planning (Skip for Quick Flow)

Create the planning documents using BMAD agents:

```bash
# PM agent creates a PRD (Product Requirements Document)
# with functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and epics
*agent pm

# Architect agent creates the architecture document
# with component diagrams, API contracts, and data flow
*agent architect

# Product Owner creates sprint stories from the PRD
*agent po

# Commit the planning docs
git add docs/ && git commit -m "feat: PRD + arch for health-endpoint"
```

Each agent is interactive — it will ask questions and present drafts for your
approval.

### Step 4: Specs (Skip for Quick Flow)

Convert the plan into formal, machine-verifiable specs with OpenSpec:

```bash
# Create a proposal for the feature
/opsx:propose health-endpoint

# Fast-forward: auto-generate all spec documents from the proposal
/opsx:ff
```

This produces structured files in the `openspec/` directory:

- `proposal.md` — What is being built and why
- `specs/` — Detailed specifications (inputs, outputs, edge cases)
- `design.md` — Technical design decisions
- `tasks.md` — Atomic tasks (each should take 2–5 minutes)

Review the generated tasks. Each one must include edge cases and a verification
step (a way to confirm the task was completed correctly).

```bash
git add openspec/ && git commit -m "spec: health-endpoint"
```

### Step 5: Impact Analysis (Skip for Quick Flow)

Before writing code, check what your changes might affect:

```bash
# Ask GitNexus what depends on the files you plan to change
"What breaks if I change the router configuration?"

# Trace the dependency path between the components you'll touch
/graphify path Router HealthController

# Check if anyone tried this before and what happened
mempalace search "health endpoint"
```

**Decision point:** If the impact spans more than 3 modules, split into smaller
PRs. If you discover new edge cases, go back to Step 4 and update the specs.

### Step 6: Brainstorm + Plan

Now use Superpowers to design the implementation:

```bash
# Brainstorm: Claude asks you Socratic questions about your approach,
# challenges assumptions, and suggests alternatives
/superpowers:brainstorm

# Generate a detailed execution plan with bite-sized tasks
/superpowers:write-plan
```

The plan will look something like:

```
Task 1: Create HealthController class
  - Write test (RED)
  - Implement (GREEN)
  - Refactor
  - Verify: test passes, endpoint responds with 200

Task 2: Add database connectivity check
  - Write test (RED)
  - Implement (GREEN)
  - Refactor
  - Verify: returns degraded status when DB is down
...
```

**Important:** Review every task before approving the plan. Each task must have a
verification step. Do not approve a plan with vague tasks like "implement the
feature."

### Step 7: Execute

Run the plan:

```bash
/superpowers:execute-plan
```

Superpowers executes each task using a RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle:

1. **RED** — Write a failing test for the task
2. **GREEN** — Write the minimum code to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR** — Clean up the code while keeping tests green

After each task:
- All tests must pass.
- One commit is made (e.g., `feat: add HealthController with basic check`).

ECC hooks run passively in the background during this step — they will
automatically block any commit that contains secrets or modifies protected
files.

> **3-Strike Rule:** If the same task fails 3 times in a row, stop and trigger
> an architectural review. The task may need to be redesigned.

### Step 8: 3-Layer Self-Review (Mandatory)

Before pushing, run three review passes:

```bash
# Layer 1: Methodology compliance
# Reviews your code against the plan, coding standards, and architecture
/superpowers:code-review

# Layer 2: Spec compliance
# Checks that your implementation matches the OpenSpec specs
make verify

# Layer 3: Knowledge graph sync
# Re-indexes the codebase so the knowledge graph reflects your changes
make index
```

**If Layer 2 fails** (implementation does not match specs), go back to Step 7
and fix the code.

**After any configuration change**, also run a security scan:

```bash
npx ecc-agentshield scan
```

### Step 9: Push the PR

```bash
git push origin feature/health-endpoint
```

The pre-push hook automatically runs `make verify` and `make scan`. If either
fails, the push is blocked until you fix the issue.

Your PR description must include:

1. **Link to the OpenSpec proposal** — so reviewers can check code against spec
2. **Impact summary** — which modules are affected and how
3. **Test results** — confirmation that all tests pass

### Step 10: Archive + Ship

After the PR is merged:

```bash
# Archive the specs (moves them to a historical record)
make archive

# Mine recent conversations for architecture decisions worth preserving
make mine

# Tag and deploy
git tag v1.2.0 && git push --tags
```

`make archive` automatically re-indexes the knowledge graph after archiving. The
`make mine` command extracts decisions from your conversation logs and stores
them in MemPalace for future reference.

### Quick Flow Summary (Bug Fixes)

For bug fixes and small changes, skip Steps 3–5:

```
Step 1: Understand     → Read the graph report, search MemPalace
Step 2: Scope          → *agent analyst → *workflow-init → choose "Quick"
Step 6: Brainstorm     → /superpowers:brainstorm
Step 6: Plan           → /superpowers:write-plan
Step 7: Execute        → /superpowers:execute-plan
Step 8: Review         → 3-layer review (mandatory even for bug fixes)
Step 9: Push           → git push
Step 10: Archive       → make archive (if specs were involved)
```

## 6. Daily Operations Reference

### Make Targets

All common operations have Make targets. Run `make help` to see the full list.

| Command | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `make setup` | Install or update all 8 tools (safe to re-run) |
| `make index` | Re-index the codebase in both GitNexus and Graphify |
| `make scan` | Run AgentShield security scan (102 rules) |
| `make scan-deep` | Run AgentShield deep scan (uses Opus model + streaming) |
| `make verify` | Check that your code matches the OpenSpec specs (Layer 2) |
| `make review` | Full 3-layer review coordinator |
| `make archive` | Archive completed specs + re-index (run after merge) |
| `make status` | Show the status of all installed tools |
| `make mine` | Extract decisions from conversations into MemPalace |
| `make clean` | Remove the GitNexus index (asks for confirmation) |

### Superpowers Commands (Inside Claude Code)

| Command | When to Use |
|---|---|
| `/superpowers:brainstorm` | Before starting any implementation — explore alternatives |
| `/superpowers:write-plan` | After brainstorming — generate a task list with verification steps |
| `/superpowers:execute-plan` | After approving the plan — execute with TDD cycles |
| `/superpowers:code-review` | After coding — review against plan, standards, architecture |

### BMAD Agent Commands (Inside Claude Code)

| Command | Which Agent | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| `*agent analyst` | Analyst | Clarifies scope, asks requirements questions |
| `*agent pm` | PM | Creates PRD with functional/non-functional requirements |
| `*agent architect` | Architect | Creates architecture document |
| `*agent po` | Product Owner | Creates sprint stories from the PRD |
| `*workflow-init` | (meta) | Choose Quick/Standard/Enterprise flow |
| `bmad-help` | (meta) | Shows what step to do next |

### OpenSpec Commands (Inside Claude Code)

| Command | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `/opsx:propose <name>` | Create a new feature proposal |
| `/opsx:ff` | Fast-forward: auto-generate all spec documents |
| `/opsx:apply` | Apply spec changes to code |
| `/opsx:verify` | Check implementation against specs |
| `/opsx:archive` | Archive completed specs |

### When to Re-Index

Run `make index` (which runs `gitnexus analyze` + `graphify . --update`):

- **After every merge** — the knowledge graph must reflect the latest code
- **After significant refactoring** — file moves, renames, module restructuring
- **Before impact analysis** — ensure you are querying up-to-date information

### When to Mine MemPalace

Run `make mine` (which runs `mempalace mine ~/chats/ --mode convos`):

- **Weekly** — as a regular maintenance task
- **After major decisions** — architecture changes, technology choices
- **Before onboarding new team members** — so the knowledge base is current

## 7. Common Mistakes

### Planning Mistakes

| Don't | Do | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Start coding before writing specs | Run `/opsx:propose` first | Without specs, there is no way to verify the code is correct. You also lose the paper trail. |
| Skip brainstorming | Run `/superpowers:brainstorm` | Brainstorming forces you to consider alternatives. The first approach is rarely the best one. |
| Approve a plan without reviewing every task | Read each task and its verification step | Vague tasks lead to vague code. Each task must be specific, atomic (2–5 min), and verifiable. |
| Skip impact analysis | Query GitNexus + Graphify + MemPalace | You might break something in a module you did not know existed. Past attempts may reveal pitfalls. |

### Execution Mistakes

| Don't | Do | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Make multiple changes in one commit | One commit per task from the plan | If something breaks, you can identify and revert the exact commit that caused it. |
| Push without 3-layer review | Run all three layers every time | Layer 1 catches methodology issues, Layer 2 catches spec drift, Layer 3 keeps the knowledge graph accurate. |
| Continue after 3 failures on the same task | Stop and do an architectural review | Repeated failure usually means the task is poorly designed or the approach is wrong — not that you need to try harder. |
| Trust AI output without review | AI writes → Superpowers reviews → you approve | AI can generate plausible-looking code that is subtly wrong. Always review. |
| Create PRs larger than 400 lines | Split into smaller PRs | Large PRs are harder to review and more likely to introduce undetected issues. |

### Memory Mistakes

| Don't | Do | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Dump knowledge into CLAUDE.md | CLAUDE.md = rules only. Use claude-mem for sessions, MemPalace for decisions. | CLAUDE.md is loaded into every conversation. Putting knowledge there wastes context window. |
| Use MemPalace for session recall | Let claude-mem handle it — it is automatic | MemPalace is for deliberate, permanent knowledge, not "what did I do yesterday." |
| Use claude-mem for architecture decisions | Store decisions in MemPalace | claude-mem uses lossy compression. Important reasoning chains can be lost. MemPalace stores verbatim. |
| Forget to mine MemPalace | Run `make mine` weekly | Decisions buried in chat logs are lost knowledge. Mining extracts and preserves them. |

### Maintenance Mistakes

| Don't | Do | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Forget to re-index after merging | Run `make index` after every merge | An outdated knowledge graph gives wrong answers to impact analysis questions. |
| Install the full ECC plugin | Cherry-pick only: AgentShield + hooks + language skills | The full plugin reduces Claude's usable context from ~200K to ~70K tokens. |
| Skip the AgentShield scan after config changes | Run `npx ecc-agentshield scan` | Config changes can accidentally expose secrets or weaken security rules. |

| **ECC** | Everything Claude Code — a community plugin for Claude Code. VSAF cherry-picks three components from it instead of installing the full plugin. |
| **FR / NFR** | Functional Requirement / Non-Functional Requirement. FRs describe what the system does ("user can log in"). NFRs describe how well it does it ("login responds within 200ms"). |
| **KG** | Knowledge Graph — a database that stores relationships between entities (files, functions, classes, services). GitNexus and Graphify both build knowledge graphs. |
| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol — a standard that lets AI models (like Claude) access external tools and data sources. GitNexus uses MCP to give Claude Code access to the code knowledge graph. |
| **PRD** | Product Requirements Document — a planning document that describes what is being built, for whom, and why. Generated by the BMAD PM agent. |
| **Quick Flow** | A shortened workflow for bug fixes and small changes. Skips Steps 3–5 (planning, specs, impact analysis). |
| **RED → GREEN → REFACTOR** | The TDD cycle: write a failing test (RED), write code to pass it (GREEN), clean up the code (REFACTOR). |
| **TDD** | Test-Driven Development — a practice where you write the test *before* writing the code. Superpowers enforces this during plan execution. |
